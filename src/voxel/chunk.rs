//! [`DenseChunk`] — the hot, transient, fully-unpacked form of a chunk.
//!
//! `DenseChunk` is *never* the long-term in-memory storage: keeping every
//! loaded chunk as 128 KB of flat arrays would burn ~2 GB at our target
//! render distance. Instead, chunks live as a palette-compressed
//! `PalettedChunk` (see `voxel::paletted` in M3) and are decompressed into a
//! `DenseChunk` only for hot, transient work — meshing, lighting recomputes,
//! and edit batches.
//!
//! The dense form is allocated on the heap (`Box<[T; N]>`) so that the 128 KB
//! payload doesn't blow up stack frames, and so that the mesher/lighter can
//! own a chunk during a job without paying any borrow cost on the world.
